# Kids Career Fair

## App Purpose

I made this to show kids at a career fair a simple program that a single person can make with buttons and effects.

## Presentation

[KidsCareerFair.pptx](KidsCareerFair.pptx)

This presentation goes through a career as a software developer. 

It is not to be reused by anyone as I have included photos of people and places. Thank you.

## Implementation

I used Google Gemini AI to generate code quickly, but found most the time the code to be unusable or using APIs that didn't exist, or were modified by the API to be incorrect.
It was fun though, and the AI did sometimes lead me in the right direction.

Also, shout out to https://github.com/DanielMartinus/Konfetti. This API is fun and great.

## Future improvements

With actual free time to work on this, I would add a ball game and more things to show off. Also needed is an actual code refactor.
